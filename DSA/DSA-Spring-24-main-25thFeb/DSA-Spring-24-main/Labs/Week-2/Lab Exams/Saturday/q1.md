# Help Saswat

<!-- # Problem Statement -->

<!----------------------->

Saswat has recently learnt to reverse linked lists for his project from his DSA TAs. However he
realized this is not enough for his project as he needs to reverse a specific subset of the linked list.
Can you help him to do this?

## Formal Statement

<!----------------------->

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers `l` and `r` where `l <= r`, reverse the nodes of
the list from position `l` to position `r`, and return the modified list.

**Please note that you have to this in-place and NOT by making a new list. The codes will be
checked manually and creating a new linked list will be given a straight 0 for the question.**

**You have to use a singly linked list only**

### Input Format

<!----------------------->

Each test consists of one test case. The description of the test cases follows.

- The first line of each test case contains two integers n, l and r the length of the linked list,
  the first index and the last index.
- The second line of each test case will contain the numbers in the linked list.

### Output Format

<!----------------------->

Output should have the modified linked list.

### Explanation

<!----------------------->

- Both indexes to be included in the reversal
- The linked list is 1 indexed i.e. the first element of the linked list will be index 1.
- You are supposed to use linked lists for the question and not by using inbuilt integer arrays.

**Using inbuilt integer arrays will result in a straight 0 for the entire lab and no queries will be
entertained.**

## Sample Test Case:

<!-- ------------ -->

### Input:

<!-- ------------ -->

```
5 2 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Output:

<!-- ------------ -->

```
1 4 3 2 5
```

## Constraints:

<!-- ------------ -->

- $1 \leq n \leq 100000$
<!-- - ~1 \leq n \leq 100000~ -->
- $1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$
<!-- ~1 \leq l \leq r \leq n~ -->
